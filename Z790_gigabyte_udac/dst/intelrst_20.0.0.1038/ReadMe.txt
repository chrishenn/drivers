steps.

Note: If you experience any difficulties making these changes to the system BIOS, please 
contact the motherboard manufacturer or your place of purchase for assistance.
 
**************************************************************************
* 11.  ENTERING THE Pre-OS USER INTERFACE
**************************************************************************

UEFI Driver/BIOS
*****************************
  Use the following steps to enter the Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology UEFI HII-
  compliant user interface (Note: the exact steps and location of the UI is OEM platform 
  dependent.  You must consult your platform manufacturer for these exact steps and 
  location of the Intel(R) RST UEFI HII UI):

    1. Boot the system.
    2. Press key required to enter the platform's system BIOS (e.g F2)
    3. Locate the ‘Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology’ item wherever it is located in your 
       platform’s system BIOS menu and enter it to launch the ‘Intel(R) Rapid Storage 
       Technology’ text-based UEFI UI. At the top of the main page of the UI the version 
       is indicated in the following format:
        'Intel(R) RST ww.x.y.zzzz SATA Driver’


**************************************************************************
* 12.  Pre-OS STORAGE SUB-SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
**************************************************************************

UEFI Driver/BIOS HII
*****************************
The Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology - UEFI UI provides pre-OS Storage sub-system 
management which enables the following capabilities:

I- RAID Volume Management
1. Create RAID Volume
   Use this option to create one or two RAID volumes.

2. Delete
   Click on a RAID volume then use this option to delete the RAID volume. The pre-OS 
   methods are the only end-user methods to delete a RAID volume that has the OS boot 
   files on it.

3. Reset to Non-RAID 
   Click on a RAID volume then click on a member disk then use this option to reset a RAID 
   member disk to a non-RAID pass-through disk.

4. Recovery Volume Options
   If a recovery volume is present, use this option to 
        a. Disable Continuous Update
        b. Enable Only Recovery Disk
        c. Enable Only Master Disk

II – Intel(R) Optane(TM) Memory Technology Management
1. ‘Deconcatenate’ Intel(R) Optane(TM) Memory Volume
   Use this option to disable Intel(R) Optane(TM) memory volume and return the system to a non-Accelerated 
   Pass-through configuration.
     a. [X] Checkbox to preserve user data upon deconcatenation; Checked is the default
     b. <No> Decision box to confirm deconcatenation action; Yes or No (No is default)
   
**************************************************************************
* 13.  OPTIONS TO RESET THE RAID VOLUME in the INTEL(R) RST Pre-OS UI's
**************************************************************************
WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!
Before completing any of the following steps, it is recommended you Backup any wanted 
data that is located on the RAID volumes being deleted or disks being reset to non-RAID

Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology - pre-OS UI provides two methods for resetting the RAID 
volume:
    > Delete RAID Volume
    > Reset Disks to Non-RAID

   Differences between the options are noted below. Users are advised to select the option 
   based on the situation.

13.1 Delete RAID Volume
     When a RAID volume is deleted, RAID metadata on the participating disks is erased and 
     sector zero is cleared; as a result, the partition table and file system related data      
     are reset. Windows installer will not see any invalid data at the time of OS 
     installation. This is the recommended method for reconfiguring the RAID volume and 
     installing OS on it.

13.2 Reset Disks to Non-RAID
     This option is used to reset the metadata on the disk which participates in more than 
     one RAID volume in single operation. It should be used if 'Delete RAID Volume' option 
     fails for any reason and to reset a disk that has been marked as Spare and offline 
     member. When a disk in the RAID volume is reset to non-RAID, RAID metadata is erased. 
     However, partition table and file system related data still exists, which may be 
     invalid. This might cause Windows installer to misinterpret the information available 
     on the 'reset disk' at the time of installation. This could result in unexpected 
     behavior in OS installation.

A listing of any such third party limitations is in one or more text files accompanying the Software. You acknowledge Intel is not providing You with a license to such third party software and further that it is Your responsibility to obtain appropriate licenses from such third parties directly.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, exchanged confidential information, as well as the Software are subject to the terms and conditions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement(s) or Intel Pre-Release Loan Agreement(s) (referred to herein collectively or individually as “NDA”) entered into by and in force between Intel and You, and in any case no less confidentiality protection than You apply to Your information of similar sensitivity. If You would like to have a contractor perform work on Your behalf that requires any access to or use of Software, You must obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the contractor which contains terms and conditions with respect to access to or use of Software no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement, excluding any distribution rights and use for any other purpose, and You will remain fully liable to Intel for the actions and inactions of those contractors.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE INTEL WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD INTEL AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) HARMLESS AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, DAMAGES, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES), ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY CLAIM OF PRODUCT LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIM ALLEGES THAT INTEL OR AN INTEL AFFILIATE, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIER WAS NEGLIGENT REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE SOFTWARE.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement and any NDA with Intel constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Neither Party will be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect to the subject matter hereof other than as expressly provided herein.

17. WAIVER. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of any provision hereof will not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself.
